AudibleMPD is a program that captures events from /dev/input/eventX and uses
those to control MPD. Due to the way it handles input, there is no requirement
for having any sort of visual output from the program. Instead, the application
provides audio cues for playlist switching/searching (and optional announcements
on song change) using the linux tool espeak (everything else has a far too slow
response time).

Requires pyMPD to be installed.
